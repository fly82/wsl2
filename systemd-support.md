Ensuring you are on the right WSL version
This change is only available in the Microsoft Store version of WSL version 0.67.6 and higher. You can check your version number by running wsl --version. If that command fails then you are running the in-Windows version of WSL and need to upgrade to the Store version.

This version of WSL is now available in the Microsoft Store to users on Windows Insiders build for initial testing, and then after a few weeks we will make it available to all users to ensure quality. You can run wsl --update to check for any WSL updates.

If you are not on Windows Insiders and want to use it immediately, you can download the latest release from the WSL release page.

Set the systemd flag set in your WSL distro settings
You will need to edit the wsl.conf file to ensure systemd starts up on boot.

Add these lines to the /etc/wsl.conf (note you will need to run your editor with sudo privileges):

```
[boot]
systemd=true
```

With the above steps done, close your WSL distro Windows and run wsl.exe --shutdown from PowerShell to restart your WSL instances. Upon launch you should have systemd running. You can check this with the command systemctl list-unit-files --type=service which should show your servicesâ€™ status.
